# Tolvex Development Roadmap: Building the Ecosystem

Last Updated: May 11, 2025 | Repository: [github.com/Tolvex/tolvex](https://github.com/Tolvex/tolvex)

Tolvex is a programming language purpose-built for healthcare analytics, with the tagline "Empowering Healthcare with Secure, Fast, and Clinician-Friendly Analytics". This roadmap outlines the development of Tolvex’s ecosystem, mirroring the robust components of the Rust ecosystem while tailoring them for healthcare needs. Tolvex’s ecosystem will support its goals of clinician accessibility, high performance, privacy, and interoperability with healthcare standards like FHIR and DICOM.

## Tolvex Ecosystem Components

Below are the planned components of Tolvex’s ecosystem, inspired by Rust’s ecosystem but adapted for healthcare analytics. Each component is designed to support Tolvex’s unique features, such as privacy-preserving analytics, real-time IoT processing, and regulatory automation.

## 1. Parser

### Role
Converts Tolvex source code (e.g., `fhir_query`, `predict_risk`) into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) through lexical and syntactic analysis.

### Tolvex-Specific
* Handles healthcare-specific syntax (e.g., `federated`, `regulate`, FHIR/DICOM constructs).
* Provides clinician-friendly error messages (e.g., “Invalid FHIR query syntax—did you mean `fhir_query("Patient")`?”).

### Implementation
Currently written in Rust, using a recursive descent parser for Tolvex’s Python/R-inspired syntax.

### Development Plan
#### Phase 1 (0–6 Months)
* Complete the parser for core syntax (`fhir_query`, `predict_risk`, `regulate`).
#### Phase 2 (6–12 Months)
* Enhance error messages for clinicians, add support for visual IDE constructs.

## 2. Compiler (`tlvxc`)

### Role
Transforms Tolvex code into executable binaries, with stages including parsing, type checking, privacy/compliance checking, and codegen.

### Tolvex-Specific
* Includes a privacy/compliance checking stage to enforce HIPAA/GDPR rules.
* Uses LLVM for codegen, targeting WebAssembly for edge devices and RISC-V for medical hardware.
* Optimizes for healthcare workloads (e.g., genomic alignment, federated learning).

### Implementation
Written in Rust, with plans to become self-hosted (see `SELF_HOSTING.md`).

### Development Plan
#### Phase 1 (0–12 Months)
* Build core `tlvxc` stages (parsing, type checking, borrow checking, codegen).
#### Phase 2 (12–18 Months)
* Add privacy/compliance checker and optimize for WebAssembly/RISC-V.

## 3. Package Manager (`tvx`)

### Role
