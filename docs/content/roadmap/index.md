# Tolvex Ecosystem & Self-Hosting Roadmap

_Last updated: May 11, 2025_

Tolvex is a programming language purpose-built for healthcare analytics, with the tagline "Empowering Healthcare with Secure, Fast, and Clinician-Friendly Analytics." This roadmap merges our ecosystem vision and the self-hosting plan, inspired by Rust’s journey to maturity.

---

## 1. Ecosystem Vision & Phased Plan

### Phase 1: Functional Compiler in Rust (0–2 Years)
- **Goal:** Complete the Rust-written `tlvxc` compiler with essential features, including Rust-like borrow checking for memory safety and concurrency.
- **Tasks:**
  - Finish recursive descent parser for Tolvex syntax (`fhir_query`, `federated`)
  - Implement type checking for healthcare types (e.g., `FHIRPatient`)
  - Add privacy/compliance checker (HIPAA/GDPR)
  - Ensure LLVM codegen supports WebAssembly and RISC-V
- **Milestone:** Tolvex 0.1 release, compiling simple healthcare analytics scripts

### Phase 2: Syntax & Ecosystem Stabilization (2–3 Years)
- **Goal:** Finalize Tolvex’s syntax and core features, expand the ecosystem
- **Tasks:**
  - Stabilize healthcare constructs (`fhir_query`, `regulate`, `predict_risk`)
  - Define the standard library (`tolvex.data`, `tolvex.ai`, `tolvex.compliance`)
  - Launch `tvx` (package manager) and `formulary.tolvex.dev` registry
  - Gather community feedback, refine language
- **Milestone:** Tolvex 0.5 release, stable language core, ecosystem growth

### Phase 3: Begin Self-Hosting Transition (3–4 Years)
- **Goal:** Start rewriting the compiler in Tolvex, using Rust compiler to bootstrap
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify a stable Tolvex subset for compiler dev
  - Rewrite parser in Tolvex, port type checker and privacy checker
  - Interface with LLVM backend via FFI
- **Milestone:** Tolvex 0.8 release, partially self-hosted compiler

### Phase 4: Complete Self-Hosting (4–5 Years)
- **Goal:** Fully rewrite `tlvxc` in Tolvex, achieving self-hosting
- **Tasks:**
  - Port all compiler components to Tolvex
  - Optimize performance
  - Bootstrap: use Rust `tlvxc` to compile Tolvex `tlvxc`, then self-compile
- **Milestone:** Tolvex 1.0 release, fully self-hosted

### Phase 5: Post-Self-Hosting (5+ Years)
- **Goal:** Maintain and enhance the self-hosted compiler
  - Add new features to `tlvxc` using Tolvex (e.g., federated learning optimizations)
  - Leverage Tolvex’s healthcare features to improve the compiler

## 2. Key Ecosystem Components (from ECOSYSTEM_ROADMAP.md)
- **Parser:** Healthcare-specific syntax, clinician-friendly errors, recursive descent (Rust → Tolvex)
- **Compiler (`tlvxc`):** Privacy/compliance checking, LLVM backend, WebAssembly/RISC-V, self-hosting
- **Package Manager (`tvx`):** Healthcare formulary, `formula.toml`, visual IDE support
- **Privacy/Compliance Checker:** Compile-time enforcement of HIPAA/GDPR/FDA
- **Type System:** Healthcare types (`FHIRPatient`, `DICOMImage`), generics, traits
- **Macro System:** Declarative/procedural macros for healthcare tasks
- **Runtime:** Minimal, with privacy and compliance hooks

---

## 3. Lessons from Rust
- **Iterative Development:** Focus on a minimal, stable subset for self-hosting
- **Community Involvement:** Use GitHub Discussions, RFCs for stabilization
- **Bootstrapping Strategy:** Gradual transition (parser first, then compiler)
- **Borrow Checking:** Adopt Rust-like borrow checking for safety and concurrency in Tolvex, ensuring memory safety and preventing data races in healthcare analytics.
